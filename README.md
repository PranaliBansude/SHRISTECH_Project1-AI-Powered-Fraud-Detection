Explaining my AI internship task/project completed at @Shris Tech.   Grateful for the hands-on learning experience.
# Project 1 – AI-Powered Fraud Detection System

## Objective
To detect fraudulent financial transactions using artificial intelligence.

## Description
This project uses a real-world transaction dataset to train a machine learning model.  
Fraudulent transactions are treated as anomalies and detected using classification techniques.

## Output
The system predicts whether a transaction is fraudulent or normal and displays evaluation metrics.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning
- Data Analysis
- Scikit-learn

This project was completed as part of the AI internship.
